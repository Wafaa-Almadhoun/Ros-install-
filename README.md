## Introduction
Robot Operating System (ROS or ros) is an open-source robotics middleware suite. Although ROS is not an operating system (OS) but a set of software frameworks for robot software development , the versions of :
1.	ROS 1
2.	ROS 2
3.	ROS-Industrial
Operating Systems ROS runs only on Unix servers. While ROS includes software for Ubuntu, Mac OS X, and Fedora, Gentoo, Arch Linux, and other Linux platforms

If you are working on Ubuntu, it doesnâ€™t matter. But what for Windows people? Here we go!

To install software, you may have to satisfy the system requirements. To install ROS in windows, you need the following system requirements.

You must have a Windows 10 64-bit device

Also, it is recommended that you have at least 20GB of free space on your C:\ drive for installation and development.

You need virtualbox to develop ROS projects for Windows. You can download virtualbox (VirtualBox 6.1.34 )platform packages [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
